some visualization programs in probability theory and mathematical statistics
The members of the project team demonstrated the actual sampling methods in probability theory, 
classic experiments including 
Buffon's pin throwing, 
coin tossing,
Galton's board, 
law of large numbers,
central limit theorem,
and three sampling distributions.
derived from normal distribution in mathematical statistics: 
Chi square distribution, 
t distribution, 
F distribution, 
gamma distribution, 
beta distribution,
and greenvenko's theorem 
with interactive animation By describing the formation process of the concept of probability, 
we can better understand the role of each parameter in a particular distribution. 
The visualization of experiment, distribution, estimation and hypothesis testing is realized.
